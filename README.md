# Gender Divide

The future is non-binary, but for now let's say it is to make things easier...

# Plan

1. Examine dataset by hand. Look for structure, mislabels, formats, etc.
2. Create image processing pipeline (resizing, downsampling, etc.).
3. Naive model implementation to use as baseline: Not-too-deep CNN w/ softmax.
4. Examine mislabeled items by hand.
5. Adjust for mislabelings (e.g. find person or not, and classify people on male/female).
6. Test data augmentation.
7. Avoid impulse to fine-tune model.
8. Make presentation.
